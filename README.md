# Space-Race-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes global rocket launch data to uncover trends in space exploration, including historical Cold War comparisons and modern commercial space activity. The analysis visualizes launch frequency, success rates, spending, and country-level competition over time.

**1) Key Features**

- Cleaned and preprocessed mission launch data, converting inconsistent date formats and normalizing country names using the iso3166 library.
- Performed data wrangling and feature extraction (e.g., launch year, country, organization, mission status).
- Created Cold War–era analyses comparing USSR and USA launch activity, failure rates, and spending from 1950–1991.
- Generated interactive visualizations using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly.express, including:
- Choropleth maps of global launch counts and failures by country
- Bar charts of launch success rates by organization
- Line charts of launch frequency and cost trends over time
- Pie charts for active vs. retired rockets and mission outcomes
- Sunburst charts showing hierarchical relationships between country, organization, and mission success
- Quantified launch dominance per year for both countries and organizations, identifying historical shifts in leadership.
